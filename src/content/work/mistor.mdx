## The Award Winning Mistor cartoons 

Mistor is a character I started drawing in the margins of my sketchbooks in college. I first tried using the character in a comic strip. Mistor frequently broke panels and did strange things with page flow, which inspired comic page style of the animations.

This cartoon was what I turned in for an animatic assignment in a storyboarding class at SCAD. Tip if you're learning pre-production: this is  not an animatic.

Email!! received multiple awards and honors 

- Transdimentional Film Fest - Outstanding Animation
- Macon Film Fest - 2nd Place Animation
- Channel Frederator Award - Nominee

The Email!! cartoon went viral, so I decided to make more cartoons with this character and make them my thesis. For this piece I animated a bunch of stray thoughts and then arranged them into some sort of loose thread 20 minutes before I had to drive over to a friend's house to record myself yelling in his closet.

WTF!? was awarded "Most Likely to be Censored by the FCC" at the Channel Frederator Awards.

After several years, I decided I wanted a Wacom tablet and a Yeti Microphone, but no one would give them to me. So I up put a kickstarter to make a new Mistor cartoon for an amount of money greater than or equal to 1 Wacom Tablet and 1 Yeti Mic. The project was a success and now I own a Wacom Tablet and a Yeti Mic.

JibJab never collected the Mistor eCards or created a tagging sysem, and they ocassionally rename, resize, and retired them. You can currently view several of them via this <a href="https://www.jibjab.com/search?term=mistor" target="_blank"> search link</a>. I am partial to <a href="https://www.jibjab.com/view/template/mister_mistor_get_well" target="_blank">Laser Hugs</a> my **most popular** eCard and <a href="https://www.jibjab.com/view/template/mister_mistor_youre_a_little_kooky" target="_blank">Water Cooler</a> my **least popular** eCard.

JibJab did a collaboration with internet video and animation artists for their line of Sendable eCards. I produced over a dozen or so shorts for this project.
