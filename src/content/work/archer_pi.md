The Archer, PI app was a game for IOS and Android designed to be played alongside viewing of Archer season 8 on FXX. The game played similarly to a Point-and-Click adventure, but you needed to pull clues from the show with your device's camera using AR in 8 separate cases linked to each of the season's 8 episodes.

The production for this game was breakneck as it was pitched and approved only 4 months before Archer season 8 would air. I was responsible for co-developing the game design, developing much of the game's level designs and narrative, writing most of the dialog, and all of the game's character animation. I rapidly taught myself Spine to rig and animate the characters in the game in a way that matched the style I animated them for the show. 

The Archer, PI app won two CLIO Awards, was nominated for a Webby Award, and was a finalist for a Shorty Award.
