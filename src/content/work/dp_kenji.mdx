I created a series of little scenes with my logo as comp exercises or experiments to either practice some old
techniques or translate techniques I learned in node-based compositing into After Effects. It seemed a shame 
to not use the renders for something, so I'm messing around a demo reel opener. This is all a work in progress.

Part of a small team, I was responsible for compositing much of the fight scene.

More to come later.
