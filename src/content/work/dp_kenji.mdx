I was part of a small team of three compositors responsible for polishing this rad anime inspired piece. I handled much of the fight scene. 
Aside from traditional "anime" comp stuff like rim lights, color treatments, bloom, gradients, etc, I also added my own impact frames, 
light trails on the robot eyes, flares, camera shakes, and more.

More to come later.
