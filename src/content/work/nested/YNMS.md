## The Emmy Award Winning 2015 Archer Scavenger Hunt

> YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR

Over a pizza some random Wednesday early in production on Archer season 6, my colleague Mark Paterson mentioned that he had snuck a little secret into the background of a shot in episode 1 that led to another secret. He'd gotten approval from the producers to keep this trail of breadcrumbs going but was wondering if I had any ideas where else this easter egg could go. I had a few suggestions, but my largest material contribution was a video game with a secret ending, which I would create between my normal duties at work over the next several weeks.

YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR was developed in Game Maker Studio. In fiction, created by the show's mad scientist Krieger, you play as Cheryl, a character on FXX's Archer known for being a firebug. The object of the game is to set fire to Malory Archer's office and escape before being burnt alive while avoiding being boxed in by the helpful toast-making robot Milton.

If you beat the game, you were shown an old NES style congratulations screen with a code hidden at the bottom which continued on the trail of scavenger hunt breadcrumbs. A later clue in the broader scavenger hunt revealed there was a code you could input to play a more difficult version of the YNMS!! game with the addition of Barry the killer robot hunting you while you burnt the office. Beating this version revealed a different end-game clue.

This game along with the collection of puzzles, crpytograms, and cyphers it was a part of won Mark and I each **Emmy Awards for Outstanding Creative Achievement**.
