I created a series of little scenes with my logo as comp exercises or experiments to either practice some old
techniques or translate techniques I learned in node-based compositing into After Effects. It seemed a shame 
to not use the renders for something, so I'm messing around a demo reel opener. This is all a work in progress.

I created this design as the logo for a fake comic book publisher back in undergrad, and I've been using it 
as a personal logo ever since. It was a skull and an exclamation point before I created Mistor. 

I decided to dust it off and while I'm experimenting and doing some comp 
exercises.

This one was basically for funsies. I've always wanted to make one of these.

I miss Archer 1999 and abusing video copilot's free Saber plugin. Similar reason I wll probably find a way to 
do one of these with their free Orb plugin. Pondering the orbs.

We loved rain in Hit-monkey, so I was taking the node based rain, window drips, and puddle ripples concepts and 
recreating them in After Effects. I need to go back to this one because the ripples hardly read and I forgot little impact splashes.
