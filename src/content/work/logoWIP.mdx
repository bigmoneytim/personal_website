> Logo

I created this design as the logo for a fake comic book publisher back in undergrad, and I've been using it 
as a personal logo ever since. I decided to dust it off and while I'm experimenting and doing some comp 
exercises.

I sort of sat down at the computer without much of a plan for all of these. There are more in less finished states as well.
I'll probably string them all together as part of my demo reel intro or outro once I've got a bunch and they're 'finished'.

I miss Archer 1999 and abusing video copilot's free Saber plugin. Similar reason I wll probably find a way to 
do one of these with their free Orb plugin. Pondering the orbs.

We loved rain in Hit-monkey, so I was taking the node based rain, window drips, and puddle ripples concepts and 
recreating them in After Effects. I need to go back to this one because the ripples hardly read and I forgot little impact splashes.
