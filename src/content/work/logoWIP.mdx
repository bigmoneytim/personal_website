I created a series of little scenes with my logo as comp exercises or experiments to either practice some old
techniques or translate techniques I learned in node-based compositing into After Effects. It seemed a shame 
to not use the renders for something, so I'm messing around a demo reel opener. This is all a work in progress.

> Logo

I created this design as the logo for a fake comic book publisher back in undergrad, and I've been using it 
as a personal logo ever since. It was a skull and an exclamation point before I created Mistor. 

I decided to dust it off and while I'm experimenting and doing some comp 
exercises.

This one was basically for funsies. I've always wanted to make one of these.

I miss Archer 1999 and abusing video copilot's free Saber plugin. Similar reason I cracked open the video copilot Orb plugin again.

We loved rain in Hit-monkey, so I was taking the node based rain, window drips, and puddle ripples concepts and 
recreating them in After Effects. Please note the little ripples in the reflective puddles and the impact splashes.

Archer 1999 nostolgia again. I'm also learning how to use VC's Element plugin here. The shatter effect takes me back to compositing vfx on Squidbillies.
